# US-Sentiment-Analysis-Model

## About
The model is made to predict the sentiments of the tweets gather from X between the time period December 2024 - January 2025. 5 models were used to predict the sentiments towards the 5 candidates. NLP methods(TFiD Vectorizer,BERT) were also included in the algorithm.The Project was made as a project for the CS209 Artificial Intelligence course.

## Models used:
1) Linear Regression
2) Neural Network Regression
3) Polynomial Regresssion
4) Neural Network Classification
5) KNN Classifier

## Preprocessing
Included cleaning the data, Scaling the data, extracting the numerical attributes. The NLP techniques were applied in the files made for individual model.
